**1-.-Code-Structure-and-Readability-Improvements

Modularized Code: Split monolithic scripts into separate modules for better organization and reusability.

Descriptive Naming: Renamed ambiguous variable and function names to enhance clarity.

Docstrings and Comments: Added clear documentation and comments to explain the logic and purpose of functions.

Removed Redundant Code: Eliminated duplicate code blocks and unnecessary computations.

**2-.-Performance-Optimization

Optimized Hand Detection Pipeline:

Used multi-threading to parallelize video capture and processing, reducing lag.

Optimized frame resizing to reduce computational load.

Efficient Data Handling:

Used NumPy arrays instead of lists for faster operations.

Cached frequently used values to avoid redundant calculations.

Reduced Latency in Cursor Control:

Implemented a smoothing function to stabilize cursor movements.

Optimized coordinate mapping to improve accuracy and responsiveness.
