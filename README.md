# CODE-REFACTORING-AND-PERFORMANCE-OPTIMIZATION
The "Hand-Controlled Virtual Mouse" is an open-source project that leverages computer vision and hand tracking to provide a touchless interface for controlling the cursor. This report details the refactoring and optimization improvements made to enhance readability, maintainability, and performance.

## Changes Implemented

**1.Code Structure and Readability Improvements**

<ins>Modularized Code</ins>: Split monolithic scripts into separate modules for better organization and reusability.

<ins>Descriptive Naming</ins>: Renamed ambiguous variable and function names to enhance clarity.

<ins>Docstrings and Comments</ins>: Added clear documentation and comments to explain the logic and purpose of functions.

<ins>Removed Redundant Code</ins>: Eliminated duplicate code blocks and unnecessary computations.

**2.Performance Optimization**

<ins>Optimized Hand Detection Pipeline</ins>:

* Used multi-threading to parallelize video capture and processing, reducing lag.

* Optimized frame resizing to reduce computational load.

<ins>Efficient Data Handling</ins>:

* Used NumPy arrays instead of lists for faster operations.

* Cached frequently used values to avoid redundant calculations.

<ins>Reduced Latency in Cursor Control</ins>:

* Implemented a smoothing function to stabilize cursor movements.

* Optimized coordinate mapping to improve accuracy and responsiveness.

## Conclusion

The refactoring and optimizations significantly improved both performance and maintainability. The system now runs more smoothly, with a higher frame rate and lower CPU utilization, while the codebase is cleaner and easier to understand. These changes make future modifications and enhancements more efficient.

## Recommendations for Future Improvements

* Explore GPU acceleration for further speed improvements.

* Implement adaptive resolution scaling to optimize performance dynamically.

* Enhance gesture recognition accuracy using machine learning.
